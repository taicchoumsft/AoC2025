## Advent of Code 2025 

With .Net 10 and C# 14 releasing a couple of weeks before AoC 2025, I couldn't resist using it to write this year's solutions. This was also a chance to write the solutions "script-style" with the new `dotnet run app.cs` functionality, so the solutions could be run individually and quickly iterated on.

All AI features were disabled in VS Code to bang up 
these solutions, though I did use AI to write the first iteration of the template. 

I aim to try to rewrite all needed helpers if I can for practice so there might be some code duplication, but the day's solution should be runnable from a single file.
